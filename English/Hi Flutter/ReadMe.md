# <span style="color:orange"><b>Hi Flutter</b></span>

This application is the simplest and the first application that each programmer or developer programs, when he/she enters the new programming language world. So, in this application, I said the flutter Hi ;)

In this section, I present the design process that takes for the "Hi Flutter" to be born. <br>

### **<p id="wireframing"><b>1.1 Wireframing</b></p>**
In this part, I present the wireframe or low-level "Hi Flutter" design.<br>

In the following image, the base wireframe of the application is presented:<br><br>

As it is seen, the application contains two main screens:
- The left screen is the first screen that contains an image of the flutter logo in the background and an image of the dash in the front. There is also a text box at the bottom and a CTA button below the text box. The button is designed to go to the right screen when the user taps it.</br></br>
- The right screen is the next screen that appears when the user taps the “Call Dash” button. A dialog box is shown with an “OK” button to close it and a text box to present some text in the dialog.

In this part, the final design of the "Hi Flutter" application is presented:<br>

The total design at one glance is like the picture below. This design was done in the Adobe XD software.<br><br>
