# <span style="color:orange"><b>Hi Flutter</b></span>

This application is the simplest and the first application that each programmer or developer programs, when he/she enters the new programming language world. So, in this application, I said the flutter Hi ;)

## **<p id="designing_part"><b>2. Designing Part</b></p>**
In this section, I present the design process that takes for the "Hi Flutter" to be born. <br>
<a href="#Table_Of_Contents">[↑ Back ↑]</a>

### **<p id="wireframing_section"><b>2.1 Wireframing</b></p>**
In this part, I present the wireframe or low-level "Hi Flutter" design.<br>

In the following image, the base wireframe of the application is presented:<br><br>

<img src="../../Assets/Hi Flutter/Presentations/Wireframing.png" width="100%" height="100%"><br>

As it is seen, the application contains two main screens:
- The left screen is the first screen that contains an image of the flutter logo in the background and an image of the dash in the front. There is also a text box at the bottom and a CTA button below the text box. The button is designed to go to the right screen when the user taps it.</br></br>
- The right screen is the next screen that appears when the user taps the “Call Dash” button. A dialog box is shown with an “OK” button to close it and a text box to present some text in the dialog.

### **<p id="designing_section"><b>2.2 Designing</b></p>**
In this part, the final design of the "Hi Flutter" application is presented:<br>

The total design at one glance is like the picture below. This design was done in the Adobe XD software.<br><br>

<img src="../../Assets/Hi Flutter/Presentations/Design - One Sight.png" width="100%" height="100%"><br>

Each designed screen is coming:

- First application screen [**Welcome Screen**] ↓ :<br><br><img src="../../Assets/Hi Flutter/Presentations/First Screen.png" width="100%" height="100%">

- Second application screen [**Dialog Screen**] ↓ :<br><br><img src="../../Assets/Hi Flutter/Presentations/Second Screen.png" width="100%" height="100%">

- First application screen landscape view [**Welcome Screen**] ↓ :<br><br><img src="../../Assets/Hi Flutter/Presentations/First Screen - Landscape.png" width="100%" height="100%">

- Second application screen landscape view [**Dialog Screen**] ↓ :<br><br><img src="../../Assets/Hi Flutter/Presentations/Second Screen - Landscape.png" width="100%" height="100%">

<a href="#Table_Of_Contents">[↑ Back ↑]</a>

### **<p id="prototyping_section"><b>2.3 Prototyping</b></p>**
In this part, I present the prototype or high-level "Hi Flutter" design.

As the functionality of this application is very simple, for its prototype, in the first application screen that is the welcome screen - whether in the portrait or landscape view - the dialog box will be shown as follows:

- Prototype of first screen [**Welcome Screen In Portrait View**] ↓ : <br><br><img src="../../Assets/Hi Flutter/Presentations/Call Dash CTA Button.png" width="100%" height="100%">

- Prototype of first screen [**Welcome Screen In Landscape View**] ↓ : <br><br><img src="../../Assets/Hi Flutter/Presentations/Call Dash CTA Button Landscape.png" width="100%" height="100%">

- Prototype of second screen [**Dialog Box Screen In Portrait View**] ↓ : <br><br><img src="../../Assets/Hi Flutter/Presentations/OK Button in the dialog box portrait.png" width="100%" height="100%">

- Prototype of second screen [**Dialog Box Screen In Landscape View**] ↓ : <br><br><img src="../../Assets/Hi Flutter/Presentations/OK Button in the dialog box landscape.png" width="100%" height="100%">

In this part, I present the final results in terms of Mockups.<br><br>

## **<p id="programming_part"><b>3. Programming Part</b></p>**
In this section, I present the programming process that takes for the "Hi Flutter" to be born.<br>
<a href="#Table_Of_Contents">[↑ Back ↑]</a>

### **<p id="front_end"><b>3.1 Front-end</b></p>**
In this part, I present what things are there in the front for user interaction.<br>

- First Screen [**Welcome Screen**] ↓ :<br><br><img src="../../Assets/Hi Flutter/Presentations/Programming Parts/Front_end_First_Screen.png" width="100%" height="100%"><br><br>

- Second Screen [**Dialog Box Screen**] ↓ :<br><br><img src="../../Assets/Hi Flutter/Presentations/Programming Parts/Front_end_second_Screen.png" width="100%" height="100%">

<br>As shown, the application is programmed as designed, with its pictures being displayed in the previous sections.

### **<p id="back_end"><b>3.2 Back-end</b></p>**
In this part, I present what things are there in the back for functionality to work.<br>

I will show what widgets are used in the background. The full details could be neglected because it makes reading this documentation boring.<br><br>

- **Flutter Picture** <br><br><img src="../../Assets/Hi Flutter/Presentations/Programming Parts/Flutter Picture.png" width="100%" height="100%"><br><br><p>As it is seen, the entire widgets are in a single "**Stack**" widget as this UI is somehow a complex one. And all of them raped around with a "**SingleChildScrollView**" widget for where it is needed it could be scrollable. Anyway, this Flutter picture logo is just an image widget that I designed previously in Ai.</p>

<br><br>

- **Dash Picture** <br><br><img src="../../Assets/Hi Flutter/Presentations/Programming Parts/Dash Picture.png" width="100%" height="100%"><br><br><p>This is an image widget too like the previous one that is positioned in the Stack widget.</p>

<br><br>

- **Bellow Dash Image Text Box** <br><br><img src="../../Assets/Hi Flutter/Presentations/Programming Parts/Start Big Journey Text.png" width="100%" height="100%"><br><br><p>This is just a text box containing the "Start your big journey" text.</p>

<br><br>

- **Call to Action Button** <br><br><img src="../../Assets/Hi Flutter/Presentations/Programming Parts/Call Dash Button.png" width="100%" height="100%"><br><br><p>This is a "**Text Button**" widget that when it is pressed, it shows a dialog box or call "**showDialog**" method used commonly in Flutter.</p>

<br><br>

- **Dialog Box Title** <br><br><img src="../../Assets/Hi Flutter/Presentations/Programming Parts/I recieved your Call.png" width="100%" height="100%"><br><br><p>After pressing the "**Call Dash**" button, a dialog box like this appears. It contains three different widgets. Its first one is a text box widget containing "**I received your Call!**" text.</p>

<br><br>

- **Dialog Box Content** <br><br><img src="../../Assets/Hi Flutter/Presentations/Programming Parts/dialog text content.png" width="100%" height="100%"><br><br><p>This is a text box too that is used as a placeholder to show some content in the dialog box.</p>

<br><br>

- **Dialog Box Button** <br><br><img src="../../Assets/Hi Flutter/Presentations/Programming Parts/OK button.png" width="100%" height="100%"><br><br><p>And in the below of the dialog box content, a button is used. After pressing, the dialog box will disappear and the first screen or welcome screen will show again.</p>
