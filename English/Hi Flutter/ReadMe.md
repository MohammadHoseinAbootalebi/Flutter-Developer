# <span style="color:orange"><b>Hi Flutter</b></span>

This application is the simplest and the first application that each programmer or developer programs, when he/she enters the new programming language world. So, in this application, I said the flutter Hi ;)

## **<p id="Designing Part"><b>2. Designing Part</b></p>**
In this section, I present the design process that takes for the "Hi Flutter" to be born. <br>
<a href="#Table_Of_Contents">[↑ Back ↑]</a>

### **<p id="wireframing"><b>2.1 Wireframing</b></p>**
In this part, I present the wireframe or low-level "Hi Flutter" design.<br>

In the following image, the base wireframe of the application is presented:<br><br>

<img src="../../Assets/Hi Flutter/Presentations/Wireframing.png" width="100%" height="100%"><br>

As it is seen, the application contains two main screens:
- The left screen is the first screen that contains an image of the flutter logo in the background and an image of the dash in the front. There is also a text box at the bottom and a CTA button below the text box. The button is designed to go to the right screen when the user taps it.</br></br>
- The right screen is the next screen that appears when the user taps the “Call Dash” button. A dialog box is shown with an “OK” button to close it and a text box to present some text in the dialog.

### **<p id="Designing"><b>2.2 Designing</b></p>**
In this part, the final design of the "Hi Flutter" application is presented:<br>

The total design at one glance is like the picture below. This design was done in the Adobe XD software.<br><br>

Each designed screen is coming:

- First application screen [**Welcome Screen**] ↓ :<br><br><img src="../../Assets/Hi Flutter/Presentations/First Screen.png" width="100%" height="100%">

- Second application screen [**Dialog Screen**] ↓ :<br><br><img src="../../Assets/Hi Flutter/Presentations/Second Screen.png" width="100%" height="100%">

- First application screen landscape view [**Welcome Screen**] ↓ :<br><br><img src="../../Assets/Hi Flutter/Presentations/First Screen - Landscape.png" width="100%" height="100%">

- Second application screen landscape view [**Dialog Screen**] ↓ :<br><br><img src="../../Assets/Hi Flutter/Presentations/Second Screen - Landscape.png" width="100%" height="100%">

### **<p id="Prototyping"><b>2.3 Prototyping</b></p>**
In this part, I present the prototype or high-level "Hi Flutter" design.

As the functionality of this application is very simple, for its prototype, in the first application screen that is the welcome screen - whether in the portrait or landscape view - the dialog box will be shown as follows:

- Prototype of first screen [**Welcome Screen In Portrait View**] ↓ : <br><br><img src="../../Assets/Hi Flutter/Presentations/Call Dash CTA Button.png" width="100%" height="100%">

- Prototype of first screen [**Welcome Screen In Landscape View**] ↓ : <br><br><img src="../../Assets/Hi Flutter/Presentations/Call Dash CTA Button Landscape.png" width="100%" height="100%">

- Prototype of second screen [**Dialog Box Screen In Portrait View**] ↓ : <br><br><img src="../../Assets/Hi Flutter/Presentations/OK Button in the dialog box portrait.png" width="100%" height="100%">

- Prototype of second screen [**Dialog Box Screen In Landscape View**] ↓ : <br><br><img src="../../Assets/Hi Flutter/Presentations/OK Button in the dialog box landscape.png" width="100%" height="100%">
